    monospaced font with programming ligatures
</h2>

Lilex is an extension of the [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex) font containing a set of ligatures from [Fira Code](https://github.com/IBM/plex) for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.
